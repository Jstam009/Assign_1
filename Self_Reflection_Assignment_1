Self Reflection: 

Through this assignment I was able to become much more comfortable with the alogirthms and logic used in C# for this first assginment. 
I felt that this assignment was fairly challenging, it assessed different areas and explored different contets and algorithms within C#. 
These however do not reflect the final question, which semeed much more daunting and confusing of a task that I could not attempt or approach in the required time. 
I was confused with the assignment for question 5, as from the TAs announcement did not seem clear to me.
